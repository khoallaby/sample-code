# Sample code

Just a small sampling of some of my latest code. Some parts may be truncated for privacy reasons or otherwise

### Laravel

- Custom class for generating `Form` elements, such as text, checkboxes, textareas, etc
- `Login controller` - this handles the login process
  - User logs in, and is sent a token to their email. They use this to log in
- `University Controller/Validator` - This handles the CRUD functions for a "University"


### React
- This is part of a multi step registration form for users
- Data is saved to Firebase
- Users can save their progress/data to their own user account, and can log in later to complete and review this.
- `Prequalify` - is one of the many steps of this registration form
  - GraphQL query to a CMS to find out what form fields should be displayed on this step.
